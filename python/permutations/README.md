# Permutations

Given a collection of **distinct** integers, return all possible permutations.

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [2,3,1],
  [3,1,2],
  [3,2,1]
]
```

## Instructions

You are free to implement the solution in any way you deem appropriate. Only requirements are the use of `Python 3.6+` in your solution and `bazel` for building and testing of your solution. `permutations_test.cpp` file contains code which needs to be executed when running `bazel test` command on this package. All tests need to pass in order for this task to be considered as solved.
