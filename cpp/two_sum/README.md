# Reverse integer

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Instructions

You are free to implement the solution in any way you deem appropriate. Only requirements are the use of `C++17` in your solution and `bazel` for building and testing of your solution. `two_sum_test.cpp` file contains code which needs to be executed when running `bazel test` command on this package. All tests need to pass in order for this task to be considered as solved.
