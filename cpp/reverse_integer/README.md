# Reverse integer

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: -123
Output: -321
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 120
Output: 21
```

**Note:**

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2<sup>31</sup>,  2<sup>31 − 1</sup>]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

## Instructions

You are free to implement the solution in any way you deem appropriate. Only requirements are the use of `C++17` in your solution and `bazel` for building and testing of your solution. `reverse_integer_test.cpp` file contains code which needs to be executed when running `bazel test` command on this package. All tests need to pass in order for this task to be considered as solved.
